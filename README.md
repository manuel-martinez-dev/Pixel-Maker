Pixel Art Maker

## Introduction

This project was part of the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.

This is simple application that creates a grid of pixels, you can choose any color you want
and then take a screenshot of your creation. :)

You can find a live example (through codepen) [here](https://codepen.io/manuel-martinez-dev/full/QzPQRa) or [here](https://manuel-martinez-dev.github.io/Pixel-Maker/)
